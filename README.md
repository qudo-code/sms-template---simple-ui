Custom autofix settings located in `./vscode/settings.json`. While this is a good solution for most cases, feel free to remove the following lines if they conflict with existing extensions like Prettier. 
```
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.stylelint": true,
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true,
},
```
